# Basic Input / Output in C++

## Header files in C++ for I/O operations

- iostream (standard input and output stream), contains definitions to objects 
like cin, cout, cerr etc.

- iomanip (input output manipulators), contains methods that manipulate streams
(setw, setprecision, etc.)

- fstream (mainly describes the file stream), handle the data read from a file
as input or data being written into the file as output

### Std. ouptut stream (cout)

- instance of the ostream class, used to produce output on the std. output device

- data needed to be displayed on the device is inserted in the stdout stream
using the insertion operator "<<"

### Std. input stream (cin)

- instance of the class istream and is used to read input from the std input
device

- extraction operator ">>" is used along th object **cin** for reading inputs
	- it extracts the data from the object **cin**
