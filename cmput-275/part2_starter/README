Assignment - Trivial Navigation System - Part II

Included Files / Directories:
    * client directory
    * server directory
    * README
    * Makefile
    * plotter

List of Makefile Targets:
    * all
    * client
    * client.o
    * clean
    * digraph.o
    * dijkstra.o
    * handle.o
    * preprocess.o
    * server.o

Running Instruction:
    - To generate generate all the executables, use "make all"
    - To compile the objects, use the following:
        - make client.o
        - make digraph.o
        - make dijkstra.o
        - make handle.o
        - make preprocess.o
        - make server.o
    - To removes the executable and the objects, use "make clean"

Note and Assumption:
    Please notice that there are additional headers files and .cpp files
    included in this build. These files separate the definition and
    implementation of functions that are frequently used so that it is
    more organized. Also, other than the functions that are the requirements
    for this assignment,functions for pre-processing and formatting are also
    included so that the code is more reusable. For detail explanation and
    implementation for these functions, please view in preprocess.h,
    preprocess.cpp, handle.h, and handle.cpp.
